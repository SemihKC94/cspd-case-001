# cspd-case-001

This project presents a robust and scalable structure, embracing modern game development principles. The codebase is designed in adherence to SOLID principles, ensuring each module has a single responsibility. The Singleton pattern provides easy and singular access to core managers like GameManager, PoolManager, SaveManager, and SoundManager, while inter-class communication dependencies are reduced through the Observer pattern (EventBroker). Data management is achieved via Scriptable Objects (Data-Driven Design), allowing for easy editing of game content. For performance optimization, an Object Pooling strategy has been adopted, mitigating the overhead associated with frequent object instantiation and destruction. Furthermore, developer-friendly features such as the ability to easily delete saved data via the SKC/Delete Save menu have been included.
